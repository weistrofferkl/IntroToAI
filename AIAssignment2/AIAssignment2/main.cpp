//  This assignment uses MCMC with Gibbs sampling to solve for the probabilty
//  of rain given that the sprinkler was on last night based on the given network diagram
//  This algorithm is based on the psudocode provided in Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig's
//  Artificial Intelligence text book, found on pgs. 536-537. For the work showing how the probabilities were
//  computed for rain and cloudy being true, please see the attached work sheet along with the assignment's
//  submission. The probabilities for wetGrass were determined based on the table included in the assignment.

#include <iostream>

//Global variables:
//Counter counts the times that rain is true
//The boolean variables are used to track whether or not a specific event is true, or has occured.
//The sprinkler variable is always set to true based on the scope of this particular problem.

/*
    The cloudyMethod sets the boolean variable 'cloudy' to true or false based on the value of rain (T/F) and 
    a precomputed probability of cloudy being true based on the value of rain. Using Bayes, I found that cloudy
    has a probability of (4/9) of being true given that rain is true, and a probability of (1/21) of being true 
    given that rain is false. It is important to remember that the value of sprinkler is always set for true for
    these probabilities.
